# Windows-Malware-Detection-AI

Windows Malware Detection Using Machine Learning
Overview
This project employs a RandomForest classifier to predict the type or family of malware based on features extracted from Windows Portable Executable files. The features span from DLL imports, API function calls, PE header fields, to PE section details.

Dataset
The dataset consists of four CSV files detailing:

DLLs Imported (DLLs_Imported.csv): Contains the DLLs imported by each malware family.
API Functions (API_Functions.csv): Contains the API functions called by these malware.
PE Header (PE_Header.csv): Contains values of 52 fields of the PE header.
PE Sections (PE_Section.csv): Contains field values of different PE sections.

Labels:
0: Benign
1: RedLineStealer
2: Downloader
3: RAT
4: BankingTrojan
5: SnakeKeyLogger
6: Spyware

Model Performance
The trained RandomForest model achieved an accuracy of 98.54% on the test set.
